# TO DOWNLOAD AND STORE WORKSHOP DATA

You will download 2 compressed foldeers and 1 compressed CSV file linked below. Please read all of these instructions before downloading. The files are called *geo_export*, *t1_2024*, and *311_Service_Requests*. Compressed (or zipped) files make it easier and faster to share big and complicated data, but once you download the files, you’ll need to decompress/un-zip/extract the folders in order to make use of the data inside.

The folders contain numerous files, all of different types. It is very important that you do not attempt to rename or move any of these individual files, they’re named for QGIS to be able to read, not for humans to be able to read. QGIS knows how to package these files together into map-able data, so it’s important that these files keep their names and stay together in a single subfolder called ‘Data.’

Moreover, when working with any data management software, but especially with mapping softwares, it’s very important that your files are organized on your computer in a way that both you AND your computer can understand and easily access. Please do not save this data folder in a subfolder of your photos folder that has pictures of your trip to Joshua Tree! And please do not leave it in your Downloads folder! Lots of errors that come up when people are learning QGIS originate in where they saved their data. Here is the workflow for best practices of data storage:

1. Create a new folder (on your desktop or wherever you can easily access it) to hold all of your present and future mapping projects, maybe titled ‘QGIS_Projects.’ 

2. In that folder, create a subfolder titled ‘First_Project’. This will be your project folder in which both your QGIS project file and your project data folder will be stored.

3. In the First_Project folder, create a subfolder titled "Data."  

4. Within the Data folder is where you’ll save the unzipped geo_export, tl_2024, and 311_Service_Requests files.

After you download, right-click the downloaded files one at a time (but do not click into the folder) and select Open, Extract, Unzip, or Decompress (this terminology depends on your OS). 
You may be asked where to extract the files to. If so, navigate to the easily accessible Data folder that you just created.
If you are not asked about where to place the folder and it just decompresses in the downloads folder, move the decompressed files into the easily accessible Data folder that you just created.

4. Now that the files are where it’s supposed to be, open the Data folder to make sure that you have 13 files.

Congratulations! You’ve downloaded the software and organized the project files! That process of data download/organization is a constant one when working with GIS. And as you collect more and more data for mapping, you’ll often re-use data in multiple projects, so it’s good that you’re forming data organization habits that will help you in the long run. Once you create your first project within QGIS, your file tree will look like this:
