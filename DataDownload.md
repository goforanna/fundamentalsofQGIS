# TO DOWNLOAD AND STORE WORKSHOP DATA

You will download a compressed folder linked below. Please read all of these instructions before downloading. The folder is called QGISData.zip. Compressed (or zipped) files make it easier and faster to share big and complicated data, but once you download the file, you’ll need to decompress/un-zip/extract the folder in order to make use of the files inside.

The folder contains about 13 files, all of different types. It is very important that you do not attempt to rename or move any of these individual files, they’re named for QGIS to be able to read, not for humans to be able to read. QGIS knows how to package these files together into map-able data, so it’s important that these files keep their names and stay together in a single subfolder called ‘Data.’

Moreover, when working with any data management software, but especially with mapping softwares, it’s very important that your files are organized on your computer in a way that both you AND your computer can understand and easily access. Please do not save this data folder in a subfolder of your photos folder that has pictures of your trip to Joshua Tree! And please do not leave it in your Downloads folder! Lots of errors that come up when people are learning QGIS originate in where they saved their data. 

1. Create a new folder (on your desktop or wherever you can easily access it) to hold all of your present and future mapping projects, maybe titled ‘QGIS_Projects.’ 

2. In that folder, create a subfolder titled ‘First_Project’. This will be your project folder in which both your QGIS project file and your project data will be stored.

3. Within the First_Project folder is where you’ll save the unzipped QGISData folder.

[Download the QGISData folder here](). 

After you download, right-click the folder (but do not click into the folder) and select Open, Extract, Unzip, or Decompress (this terminology depends on your OS). 
You may be asked where to extract the folder to. If so, navigate to the easily accessible First_Project folder that you just created.
If you are not asked about where to place the folder and it just decompresses in the downloads folder, move the decompressed QGISData folder into the easily accessible First_Project folder that you just created.

4. Now that the folder is where it’s supposed to be, open it to make sure that you have 13 files. If you don’t have 13 files, please let me know! Something may have gone wrong during downloading and extracting. 

Congratulations! You’ve downloaded the software and organized the project files! That process of data download/organization is a constant one when working with GIS. And as you collect more and more data for mapping, you’ll often re-use data in multiple projects, so it’s good that you’re forming data organization habits that will help you in the long run.
