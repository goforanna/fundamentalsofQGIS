# QGIS Installation Guide
Please read these semi-brief instructions in full to ensure you’ve properly installed QGIS.
## TO DOWNLOAD QGIS   
1. Before downloading, please make sure that your Operating System (OS) is up to date. If you are using a Windows PC, check to see if any Windows updates are available and install them before proceeding. If you have a Mac, check to see if you have the latest release of MacOS installed and if there are any system updates or security patches available, download and install them before moving on to the next step below. If you have another OS, I trust that you know better than me how to check for updates on your machine.
2. Go to the [download page](https://qgis.org/download/) for QGIS. The QGIS should detect your OS and present you with the appropriate versions. If it doesn’t, see all of the download options [here](https://qgis.org/resources/installation-guide/).
3. QGIS is available on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android and iOS. Click the appropriate link to download the **Long Term Version** (3.40.14 'Bratislava') for your OS. If you feel unclear about where to find the appropriate download for your machine, you can get more info and see all of the download options [here](https://qgis.org/resources/installation-guide/).
4. Once the file has been downloaded, you’ll need to actually install the software on your machine.
   
    ### For Windows users:
    Opening the downloaded file will open the Installer Wizard. Follow the instructions and make sure to click Install to begin the installation process. This should take 5 minutes or less.


   
    ### For Mac users:
    After downloading QGIS, open the DMG file. Drag and drop the QGIS application into the Applications folder. The first launch attempt may fail due to Apple’s security framework.
            
      **For macOS Sonoma and earlier**: To enable QGIS, command-click on its icon in your Applications folder and select Open in the context menu. A confirmation dialog will display where you need to click the Open button again. This only has to be done once.
             
      **For macOS Sequoia and newer**: To enable QGIS, command-click its icon in your Applications folder and select Open from the context menu. A warning dialog will appear; click the Done button. Next, navigate to System Settings > Privacy & Security and scroll to the Security section. You should see a message stating that “QGIS” was blocked to protect your Mac. Click Open Anyway. A confirmation dialog will appear; click Open Anyway again. This only has to be done once.
5. Once QGIS LTR has been installed as an application on your machine, open the application! Just to make sure that there were no errors during installation.
