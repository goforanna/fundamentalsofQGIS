# Creating a Map Layout

You've made it to the final step of the map-making workflow for QGIS, which is transforming this map canvas into a final, sharable format. This is called a map **Layout**. 

Once your map looks exactly how you want it in the map canvas (layers turned on, colors set), go to the menu and select Project > New Print Layout.

Give your layout a name (e.g., "NYC Noise Complaints, Jan-March 2024").

A new window will open. This is your "paper" workspace.
